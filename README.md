# Zodiac CLI Application

The Zodiac App is a CLI application built in Ruby, which displays a daily horoscope based on a user’s zodiac sign. We’ve tried to make this application as fun and as whimsical as possible, including an opening theme music and different astrological themed emojis. 

Users are able to save a horoscope to their favorites, see detailed info on their astrological sign, and if they would like to change their zodiac sign, they’re able to do that too. We’ve used SQLite3 for our database and ActiveRecord to make database migrations. 

This version is our ‘MVP,’ and future updates we’d like to make are:
 * Generating horoscopes and zodiac sign information from an API.
 * A sign-in interface where users can access their favorite horoscopes.
